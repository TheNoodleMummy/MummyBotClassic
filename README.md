# MummyBot
Mummybot makes use of [Casino Boyale's](https://github.com/TheCasino) [TaskQueue](https://github.com/TheCasino/Casino.Common/tree/master/src/Casino.Common/Entities/TaskQueue)
and a customized version of [MessageService](https://github.com/TheCasino/Espeon/blob/Rewrite/Espeon/Services/MessageService.cs) 
plus the required [Utilities](https://github.com/TheCasino/Espeon/tree/Rewrite/Espeon/Utilities).

Mummybot also makes use of [Foxbot's](https://github.com/foxbot) [Discord.Addons.Interactive](https://github.com/foxbot/Discord.Addons.Interactive)


this branch is currently undergoing a full rewrite of the bot so dont expect it to be stable or anything.
